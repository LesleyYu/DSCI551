in this database:

Consider three tables W, H, and D, storing the weight (in pounds), height (in centimeters), and
demographic information (gender and age) of people.


Create View WHD AS
select D.Name, W.Weight, H.Height from W,H,D
where D.Name = W.Name and D.Name = H.Name and D.Age >= 25 and D.Gender = "M";

Write an SQL query that uses the above view to find the name and weight of males whose age is between 25 and 30.

Is this query correct?

select WHD.Name, WHD.Weight from WHD 
left outer join D
on WHD.Name = D.Name 
where D.Age <= 30;
